## Solution
This is the very first task of the Ethernaut Challenges.

The idea of the task is to explore how the game works.

To solve this task just type the commands the game wants you to.

To solve it you have to :

```javascript
// 1
await contract.password()
// 2
await contract.authenticate(string memory passKey)
```

The password is "ethernaut0"
